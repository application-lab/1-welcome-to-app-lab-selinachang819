# Emerging Media and My Digital Life

**I have benefited a lot from Internet.**
1. *Online payment and banking system* since we don’t have to bring cash everywhere with us which is sometimes troublesome. In addition, we don’t have to go to the bank on their working hours to make investment and stuff.
2. *Online shopping* By visiting retailing website, we can easily buy lots of foreign beauty products and clothes within a week. 
3. *Social media!* Social media connects me with my friends from all over the world.

**What I have suffered from digital life are trivial, but they still hurt.** 
1. Being defrauded on WeChat and Weibo when I try to buy concert tickets from other people. Since the account is anonymous, we can’t really track who’s doing bad to us. They can just take your money and then delete the account and keep on deceiving other people. *What I would like to do to mitigate the problem, is to enact the real-name policy on every social media platform, so that they can get sued.*
2. I would say is **instant messaging**. Because it is so convenience to chat and share various content through those apps such as WeChat, I feel that I just cannot get rid of all these social relationships, spending so much time sending spam. *What I think can solve the problem is that inside the app, set up a function to check how much messages you’ve sent throughout the day, and give you warning once you send too much useless messages ( detected by the software as well)*.
3. Even though online shopping is convenient, you sometimes receive fake product and you cannot get refund. *For this one, I think we should add in more supervision to Taobao and stuff.*
